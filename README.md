# Blinker

One day while looking at a field of windmills in the country, I realized the little red lights on top all blinked in unison and consistently. I timed how often they blinked and for how long, then made a playlist of songs that "go with the blinking red lights". I later realized that some windmills blink differently than others. I made this project to mimic a field of windmills and to help me test songs and BPMs to see which ones work with which windmills.
